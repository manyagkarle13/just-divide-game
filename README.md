# 🎮 Just Divide – Kid Mode

A responsive **React.js** implementation of the **Just Divide – Kid Mode** math puzzle game.
The game helps children practice division, factors, and strategic thinking through an interactive drag-and-drop grid system.

This project was built as part of a **Frontend Engineering assignment** focusing on:

* UI accuracy
* Game logic
* Responsiveness

## 📌 Project Overview

The player drags number tiles into a **4×4 grid**.
Tiles interact based on division rules:

* Equal numbers disappear
* Divisible numbers merge into a quotient
* Results equal to **1** are removed
* Score increases with successful merges
* Game ends when the grid is full and no moves remain

The application is fully responsive and supports:

* Desktop
* Tablet
* Mobile devices
